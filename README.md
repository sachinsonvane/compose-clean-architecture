# Jetpack Compose Clean Architecture
### Modularization 
Modularization is a practice of organizing a codebase into loosely coupled and self contained parts. Each part is a module. Each module is independent and serves a clear purpose. By dividing a problem into smaller and easier to solve subproblems, you reduce the complexity of designing and maintaining a large system.

### Jetpack Architecture Components 

     1. Lifecycle
     2. Viewmodel
     3. Hiltviewmodel
     4. Compose
     5. LiveData
     6. Navigation
     7. Coroutines
     8. Dagger
     9. Flow
## Testability
Each component can be tested independently, allowing for comprehensive unit and UI testing.
## Reactivity
ViewModel‚Äôs observability and Jetpack Compose‚Äôs recomposition ensure that your UI stays in sync with your data.
## Scalability
As your app grows, MVVM‚Äôs modular structure and Jetpack Compose‚Äôs composable functions make it easier to add and modify features.
## Code Readability
Declarative UI code in Jetpack Compose is highly readable, making it easier for developers to understand and collaborate on projects.
